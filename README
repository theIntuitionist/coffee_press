CoffeePress
===========

Coffee Press cleanly integrates coffee script with your rails project.  

Benefits:
* Errors in compilation show up as alerts on your page so you don't have to wonder if you have a logical or syntactic error
* Independant rake task doesn't assume passenger, and doesn't run during the request response cycle
* Works with Rails 3, should work with rails 2

Install
======

rails plugin install git://github.com/theIntuitionist/coffee_press.git


Usage
=====

rake coffee:press
